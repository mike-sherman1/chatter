# Community TODO

## general guidelines, check slack for specifics

- **top priority:** read tinyIB open source license, let mike or dev team know if we can legally use it in chattr. link here:
https://github.com/tslocum/TinyIB/blob/master/LICENSE
- check slack to see if the development teams need any community tasks
- if not, then you're done :) just post memes until site launch
- if you get really bored, feel free to start writing FAQ or landing page in a word document or txt file, upload to slack for version control. you can just copy the rules / FAQ from 4chan. write it in a .txt or a .md
