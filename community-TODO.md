# Community TODO

## general guidelines, check slack for specifics

- **top priority:** read tinyIB terms of service, let mike or dev team know if we can legally use it in chattr. link here:

- check slack to see if the development teams need any community tasks
- if not, then you're done :) just post memes until site launch
