# Chatter
Work in progress. An open source anonymous imageboard for "normies."

## Proposal:
The basic idea is 4chan for "normies." A completely anonymous imageboard where you can post whatever you want. No upvotes, no accounts, no post history. A place where conservative young people can go to confess that they voted for Trump. On my twitter feed at least, it would be social suicide to tweet that you voted for Trump. A place where you can come post something that is not tied to your Facebook or your Twitter or anything; just a completely anonmyous post to a group of completely anonymous people.

Marketed towards people who are sick of social media. A "social media" imageboard for the common smartphone user. Marketed as "a social media with out all the bullsh&ast;t. are you sick of everything not being in chronological order on your various social feeds? are you sick of 'top stories,' of 'sponsored content?' do you miss old facebook? or AIM? or myspace? come to chatter."
